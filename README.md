Bank REST API

From a functional perspective, the following features should be implemented:
1. Creation and deactivation of users
2. Ability for users to deposit/withdraw money from their accounts
3. Ability for users to transfer money to another user's account
4. View account balances
5. View transaction history

From a technical perspective:
We expect you to deliver a functional web application that can be run
locally. You can use any programming language and framework of your choice
(although we would prefer if you used Java or Go).
The application should use in memory storage (eg: maps or dictionaries),
and it should not be necessary to install any database software to run it.
You are free to make assumptions whenever you feel it is necessary, but please
document them.
